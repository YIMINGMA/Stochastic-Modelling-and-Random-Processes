\section{Semi-Markov Chains}

\begin{definition}[Semi-Markov Chains]
    Take a discrete-time Markov chain and make a continuous-time process by waiting a time $W_x$ in each state $x \in S$ independently of previous and future states but not necessarily exponentially distributed.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    Semi-Markov chains allow for latent periods and variations of infectivity with time from infection.
