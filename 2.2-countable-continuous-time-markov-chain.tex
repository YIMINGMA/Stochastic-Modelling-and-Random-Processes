\section{Countable Continuous-Time Markov Chains}

Now suppose the state space $S$ of a continuous-time Markov chains is countable. We can define the null and positive recurrence as in the discrete-time case, but we have to find the return time differently. 

\begin{definition}[First Return Time]
    The \textbf{first return time} to state $x \in S$ is defined as 

    \begin{equation*}
        \inf\{t > J_1: X(t) = x\},
    \end{equation*}

    for $X(0) = x$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
    Each positive recurrent absorbing component has a unique stationary probability distribution $\mbf{\pi}$, and 

    \begin{equation*}
        \mbf{\pi} = \frac{\E [W_x]}{\E[T_x]}.
    \end{equation*}
\end{proposition}

In continuous time, the process can get ``explosion''. 

\begin{definition}[Explosion]
    Let $J_\infty = \lim\limits_{n\to\infty} J_n$. If $\Prob [J_\infty = \infty] < 1$, then the continuous-time Markov chain is called \textbf{explosive}, which means there is a positive probability for infinitely many events in a bounded time.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
    If $\sup\limits_{i \in S} |G_{i,i}| < \infty$, then the continuous-time Markov chain is \textit{not eplosive}.
\end{proposition}

\begin{example}[Explosion]
    Consider a birth and death process with  $X(0) = 1$, $\alpha_i = i^2$ and $\beta_i = 0$. Then 

    \begin{equation*}
        \E[J_\infty] = \sum_{i = 2}^\infty \E [W_i] = \sum_{i = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{\alpha_i} = \sum_{i = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{i^2} < \infty,
    \end{equation*}

    which means with probability $1$ $J_\infty$ is finite.
\end{example}
