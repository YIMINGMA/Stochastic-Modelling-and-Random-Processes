\section{Barab\'{a}si-Albert Model}

Consider the Barab\'{a}si-Albert model starting with $m_0 = 5$ connected nodes, adding in each timestep a node linked to $m=5$ existing distinct nodes according to the preferential attachment rule. Simulate the model for $N = |V| = 1000$, with at least $20$ independent realizations.
