\section{Countable Markov Chains}

One can extend much of what we have done for finite discrete-time Markov chains to the countably infinite case, e.g. simple random walk on $\mbb{Z}$, but some results become more subtle. For example, SRW is not SP ergodic, despite being irreducible. (Actually, it even fails to have a stationary probability.) Also, it is not periodic; it has a period $2$. So, one has to refine various concepts. 

\begin{definition}[Transience \& Recurrence]
    Let $T_x := \inf \{ t \ge 1 : X_n = x \}$. Then the state $x \in S$ is 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{transient}, if 
        \begin{equation*}
            \prob \left[ T_x = \infty | X_0 = x \right] > 0;
        \end{equation*}
        \item \textbf{null recurrence} if 
        \begin{equation*}
            \prob \left[ T_x < \infty | X_0 = x \right] = 1 \quad \& \quad \E \left[ T_x | X_0 = x \right] = \infty;
        \end{equation*}
        \item \textbf{positive recurrence} if 
        \begin{equation*}
            \prob \left[ T_x < \infty | X_0 = x \right] = 1 \quad \& \quad \E \left[ T_x | X_0 = x \right] < \infty.
        \end{equation*}
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    If $x\in S$ is transient, then with probability $1$ that $X_n$ comes back to $x$ only finite many times.
\end{remark}

\begin{proposition}
    A communicating class is either null recurrent or positive recurrent.
\end{proposition}

\begin{theorem}
    An absorbing component has a stationary probability if and only if it is positive recurrent. Furthermore, it is unique, and 
    \begin{equation*}
        \pi(x) = \frac{1}{\E [T_x | X_0 = x]}
    \end{equation*}
\end{theorem}
