\section{Semi-Markov Chains}

Take a discrete-time Markov chain and make a continuous-time process by waiting a time $W_x$ in each state $x$ independently of previous and future states (but $W_x$ is not necessarily exponentially distributed). This continous-time process is called a \textbf{\textcolor{myblue}{semi-Markov chain}}.

Semi-Markov chains allows for latent period and more general variations of infectivity with time from infection, etc.
